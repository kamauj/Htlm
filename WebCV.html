        <h2>Hello There!</h2>
        <p>My name is Jesse Kamau. Mathematics and computer science have always been a big part of my life and knowing that both disciplines require in-depth problem solving meant that I had a very simple decision when it came to choosing degree. As an individual I enjoy the feeling of accomplishment which I receive when I solve a problem, it makes me crave more hence why I wish to expand my knowledge further more in Computer Science and Mathematics. Personally I am a highly committed individual who can work well independently or as part of a team and able to self-teach how to programme in different programming languages.</p>
        <p>Throughout my years I have been involved in various sporting actives and outside of my academic life I have been apart of a football for many years, and in my career me and my team have won trophies, and through this club I learnt how to work efficiently as a team and also respect for others and officials. I have brought all these skills into my academic life which has enabled me to improve my whole.</p>
        <p>I first learned how to program back in secondary school, the passion still remains to this day. I hope to develop useful software in the near future. I have many interests when it comes to coding in general. I enjoy front-end development and UI design very much because of the freedom I have to paint my vision. I also am very fond of complex backend systems that require critical thinking skills and logic.</p>
